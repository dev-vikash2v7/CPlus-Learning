# abstraction

#encapsulation

# data hiding

# inheritence

# polymorphism -> can take many forms

            it has followint types:
                                *  Coercion
                                    => 
                                *  Overloading

                                *  parametric polymorphism

                                * inclusive polymorphism

* inheritence
       * allows creating classes from existing classes through an IS-A relationship

        *  if Class B inherits from class A then B is called the specialization  of generalised class  A
  
        * Class A is called the base class

        imp features:
                1.code reuse 
                2. subtyping
